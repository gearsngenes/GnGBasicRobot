# GnGBasicRobot
Contains the library and example codes of GnGBasicRobot, developed to help run a basic 2 wheeled robot. It can move forward and backward, rotate left and right, and completely stop.

Additionally, we have provided methods to distinguish from in-place turning and pivot turning for our robots.
